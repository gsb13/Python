    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Both are used to remove data from a table, but they work differently. `DELETE` is a DML command that removes rows one at a time and can use a `WHERE` clause to filter rows. It's slower but allows for rollback. `TRUNCATE`, on the other hand, is a DDL command—it removes all rows instantly and can't be filtered. It's faster, but in some databases, it resets identity columns and may not fire triggers.\"\n",

    "> * **DCL**: Data Control Language, which includes `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.\n",
    "> * **TCL**: Transaction Control Language, with commands like `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"`CHAR` is a fixed-length data type, so if you define `CHAR(10)` and store 'abc', it will pad the remaining space with blanks. `VARCHAR` is variable-length—it only uses as much storage as the string needs. `VARCHAR` is more space-efficient for varying text, while `CHAR` is better for fixed-length fields like status codes.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"`NULL` represents an unknown or missing value in SQL. It’s not the same as zero or an empty string. We can’t use `=` or `!=` with NULL— instead, we use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` to check for it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
