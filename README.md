# String Problems Notebook

This notebook, `String Problems.ipynb`, contains a collection of common string manipulation problems and their solutions in Python. Each problem is presented with multiple approaches, including explanations and sample outputs.

## üìë Index

1. **Palindrome Check**
   - Using string slicing
   - Using a loop
   - Using recursion
   - Using two-pointer technique

2. **First Non-Repeating Character**
   - Using a dictionary
   - Using `collections.Counter`
   - Using `index()` and `count()`

3. **Check if Two Strings Are Anagrams**
   - Using `sorted()`
   - Without inbuilt functions
   - Using `collections.Counter`

4. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
   - Sliding window technique

5. **String Compression**
   - Counting consecutive characters

6. **Email Validation**
   - Using regular expressions

7. **Reverse Words in a Sentence**
   - Using split and join
   - Using a loop
   - Using index-based reversal

8. **Reverse Each Word in a Sentence**
   - Using slicing
   - Using a loop
   - Using two-pointer technique
